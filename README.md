Simple 2d realizations of power spectra, essentially simplified Cosmic Microwave Background simulations.  Includes simple fit, comparison to theory, and basic bayesian analysis of model parameters in the Jupyter notebook.  A more minimal _Mathematica_ notebook is also included.  See https://garrettgoon.com/gaussian-fields/ for more background.
